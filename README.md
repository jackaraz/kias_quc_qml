## Installation

Before starting the tutorial, please install the requirements. 
This tutorial uses TensorFlow, TensorNetwork, PennyLane, and Qiskit packages. To install requirements, please 
use the following command;
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Content

* `tensor_contractions.ipynb`: includes introductory examples about tensor contractions.
* `examples_tns.ipynb`: includes ML examples using tensor networks.
* `vqe.ipynb`: includes examples on variational quantum eigensolver.
* `vqt.ipynb`: includes an example on variational quantum thermaliser.
* `time_evolution.ipynb`: includes examples of quantum simulation.

## Project

The `project_chemical_potential.ipynb` file includes a student project based on simulating phase transitions with VQE for a non-linear sigma model with chemical potential.
